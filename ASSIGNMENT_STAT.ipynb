        "\n",
        "These measures describe how spread out or dispersed the data are. Common measures include:\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variance\n",
        "\n",
        "  Definition: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies how much the data points differ from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How to Use: Variance is used to understand the degree of spread in the data. A high variance means data points are widely spread out from the mean, while a low variance means they are close to the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: For a dataset, calculate the difference between each data point and the mean, square these differences, and then find the average of the squared differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  When to Use: Variance is useful when you need to quantify the overall variability in a dataset, though its unit is the square of the data's original unit (e.g., squared dollars, squared meters).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Standard Deviation\n",
        "\n",
        "  Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It gives a measure of the average distance of each data point from the mean, in the same units as the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How to Use: Standard deviation is commonly used to describe the spread of data points in relation to the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: In a dataset of exam scores, a low standard deviation indicates that most scores are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation shows a wider range of scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "  When to Use: The standard deviation is widely used in both research and practical applications to measure variability, as it is easy to interpret and in the same units as the data.\n"
